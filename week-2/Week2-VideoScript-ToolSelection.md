### The Four Categories of AI Tools (3 minutes)

**[Visual: Four tool categories with icons and descriptions]**

"Let me introduce you to the four main categories of AI tools, each with different strengths and best use cases:

**[Visual: Chat Tools section with examples]**

**Category 1: Chat Tools**
- **Examples:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- **Best for:** Brainstorming, analysis, writing, problem-solving
- **Strengths:** Conversational, flexible, great for exploration
- **Limitations:** No direct file manipulation, limited automation

**[Visual: No-Code Tools section with examples]**

**Category 2: No-Code/Low-Code Tools**
- **Examples:** Bubble, Zapier, Airtable, Notion AI, Cursor (basic mode)
- **Best for:** Building functional prototypes, automating workflows
- **Strengths:** Visual interfaces, rapid prototyping, business user friendly
- **Limitations:** Less customization, platform dependencies

**[Visual: IDE Tools section with examples]**

**Category 3: IDE Tools**
- **Examples:** Cursor (advanced), GitHub Copilot, Replit, CodePen
- **Best for:** Building custom applications, serious development
- **Strengths:** Full control, professional development practices, scalable
- **Limitations:** Steeper learning curve, requires technical knowledge

**[Visual: CLI Tools section with examples]**

**Category 4: CLI/API Tools**
- **Examples:** OpenAI API, Anthropic API, custom scripts
- **Best for:** Automation, integration, advanced workflows
- **Strengths:** Maximum flexibility, automation potential, integration
- **Limitations:** Technical complexity, requires programming knowledge

**[Visual: Tool spectrum showing progression from simple to complex]**

"Notice how these tools form a spectrum from simple and accessible to complex and powerful. The key is matching the right tool to your project needs and skill level."

### The Tool Selection Decision Framework (4 minutes)

**[Visual: Decision tree flowchart]**

"Now let's talk about how to choose the right tool for your specific project. I'll walk you through five key questions that will guide your decision:

**[Visual: Question 1 with examples]**

**Question 1: What's your project's complexity level?**
- **Simple:** Single feature, limited scope, proof-of-concept → Chat tools
- **Medium:** Multiple components, some integration → No-code tools
- **Complex:** Custom logic, scalability needs → IDE tools
- **Advanced:** Automation, integration, enterprise → CLI/API tools

**[Visual: Question 2 with examples]**

**Question 2: What's your technical comfort level?**
- **Beginner:** Comfortable with chat interfaces, want guided experience → Chat + No-code
- **Intermediate:** Can handle some complexity, want more control → No-code + IDE
- **Advanced:** Comfortable with technical tools, want full control → IDE + CLI

**[Visual: Question 3 with examples]**

**Question 3: What's your timeline?**
- **Rush (days):** Need something working quickly → Chat + No-code
- **Moderate (weeks):** Have time for proper setup → No-code + IDE
- **Long-term (months):** Building for the future → IDE + CLI

**[Visual: Question 4 with examples]**

**Question 4: What's your project's expected lifespan?**
- **Short-term:** Proof-of-concept, experiment → Chat + No-code
- **Medium-term:** Will be used for months, might evolve → No-code + IDE
- **Long-term:** Production system, needs to scale → IDE + CLI

**[Visual: Question 5 with examples]**

**Question 5: What's your budget and resource situation?**
- **Free/Low-cost:** Personal projects, experiments → Chat + No-code free tiers
- **Moderate:** Business use, some budget → No-code paid plans + IDE
- **High:** Professional development, full resources → IDE + CLI with APIs

**[Visual: Decision matrix combining all factors]**

"Use these questions to plot your project on our decision matrix. Remember: **you can start with one tool and evolve to others as your project grows.**"

### Real-World Tool Selection Examples (3 minutes)

**[Visual: Three project examples with tool recommendations]**

"Let me show you how this framework applies to real projects:

**[Visual: Project 1 - Internal Tool]**

**Project 1: Internal Team Communication Tool**
- **Complexity:** Medium (multiple features, some integration)
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate (team has mixed skills)
- **Timeline:** Moderate (4-6 weeks)
- **Lifespan:** Medium-term (will be used for months)
- **Budget:** Moderate (business use)
- **Recommended Tools:** No-code platform (like Bubble or Airtable) with Chat AI for brainstorming
- **Why:** Balances functionality with accessibility, allows non-technical team members to contribute

**[Visual: Project 2 - Customer-Facing Feature]**

**Project 2: Customer-Facing Mobile App Feature**
- **Complexity:** Complex (custom logic, scalability needs)
- **Technical Level:** Advanced (experienced team)
- **Timeline:** Long-term (3-6 months)
- **Lifespan:** Long-term (production system)
- **Budget:** High (professional development)
- **Recommended Tools:** IDE tools (like Cursor) with CLI/API for automation
- **Why:** Need full control, scalability, and professional development practices

**[Visual: Project 3 - Quick Prototype]**

**Project 3: Rapid Prototype for User Testing**
- **Complexity:** Simple (single feature, proof-of-concept)
- **Technical Level:** Beginner (designer leading)
- **Timeline:** Rush (1-2 weeks)
- **Lifespan:** Short-term (testing only)
- **Budget:** Free/Low-cost (experiment)
- **Recommended Tools:** Chat AI + No-code free tier
- **Why:** Speed and simplicity matter more than polish

**[Visual: Evolution path showing how projects can move between tools]**

"Notice how projects can evolve from one tool category to another. Start where you're comfortable and capable, then move up as your needs and skills grow."

### The Tool Comparison Matrix (2 minutes)

**[Visual: Tool comparison matrix on screen]**

"I've created a tool comparison matrix to help you evaluate your options. You'll find this in your Week 2 materials.

**[Visual: Matrix sections being filled out]**

**For each tool category, the matrix covers:**
- **Learning Curve:** How long to get productive
- **Development Speed:** How quickly you can build
- **Customization:** How much you can modify
- **Scalability:** How well it handles growth
- **Cost:** Free to premium pricing
- **Best Use Cases:** When to choose this tool
- **Limitations:** What it can't do well

**[Visual: Example matrix partially filled out]**

**Example for No-Code Tools:**
- Learning Curve: Low (weeks to productive)
- Development Speed: High (rapid prototyping)
- Customization: Medium (platform limitations)
- Scalability: Medium (depends on platform)
- Cost: Medium (subscription-based)
- Best Use Cases: Prototypes, simple apps, business tools
- Limitations: Platform lock-in, limited customization

**[Visual: Decision framework summary]**

**Your homework this week:**
1. Use the decision framework to analyze your capstone project idea
2. Complete the tool comparison matrix for your top 3 tool options
3. Share your tool selection reasoning in our cohort discussion

### Common Tool Selection Mistakes (1.5 minutes)

**[Visual: Warning signs with examples]**

"As you start making tool decisions, here are some common mistakes to avoid:

**[Visual: Mistake 1]**

**Mistake 1: Choosing the Most Advanced Tool**
Don't pick IDE or CLI tools just because they're powerful. Start where you're comfortable and can be productive.

**[Visual: Mistake 2]**

**Mistake 2: Underestimating Learning Time**
Every tool has a learning curve. Factor in time to become productive, not just time to build.

**[Visual: Mistake 3]**

**Mistake 3: Ignoring Long-Term Costs**
Free tools often have limitations. Consider what happens when you outgrow free tiers.

**[Visual: Mistake 4]**

**Mistake 4: Not Planning for Evolution**
Your project will grow. Choose tools that can evolve with your needs or that you can migrate from.

**[Visual: Success indicators]**

**Signs you're making good tool choices:**
- You can be productive within your timeline
- The tool matches your skill level and learning capacity
- You have a plan for scaling or migrating if needed
- The cost is sustainable for your project's lifespan
- You're not fighting against the tool's limitations"
