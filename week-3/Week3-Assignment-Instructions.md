```
Help me create an empathy map for [USER TYPE] who needs [YOUR SOLUTION].

Consider:
1. What would they say about this problem or solution?
2. What might they be thinking privately?
3. What actions do they currently take?
4. What emotions might they experience?

## Ethical Design Principles to Remember

**Core Principles:**
1. **User Agency First** - AI assists, humans decide
2. **Transparency Always** - Be honest about AI involvement
3. **Design for Everyone** - Accessibility and inclusion matter
4. **Privacy by Default** - Minimize data collection
5. **Question AI Necessity** - Could simpler solutions work?

**When in Doubt:**
- Default to more user control
- Be more transparent, not less
- Test with diverse users
- Ask for feedback early and often
- Choose ethics over convenience

Remember: Building ethical AI is a learning journey. Focus on progress, not perfection. Every thoughtful decision you make contributes to better AI for everyone.
