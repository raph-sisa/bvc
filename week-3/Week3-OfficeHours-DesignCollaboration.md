### Empathy Mapping Deep Dive (5 minutes)
**Facilitator Demonstration:**
- Show detailed empathy mapping process
- Walk through a complete example
- Explain how to extract insights from empathy maps

**Empathy Map Quadrants:**
```
        SAYS                    |                THINKS
What do they say aloud?         | What might they be thinking?
Direct quotes, expressions      | Unspoken thoughts, worries
________________________________|________________________________
        
        DOES                    |                FEELS
What actions do they take?      | What emotions do they feel?
Observable behaviors            | Emotional states, concerns
________________________________|________________________________

                    USER GOALS & PAIN POINTS
            What are they trying to achieve?
            What frustrates or worries them?
```

**Example: Project Manager using AI tools**
- **Says:** "I need better visibility into project status"
- **Thinks:** "I'm worried the team won't adopt another new tool"
- **Does:** Still uses spreadsheets despite having project management software
- **Feels:** Overwhelmed by too many tools, anxious about missing issues
- **Goals:** Clear project visibility, team collaboration, reduce overhead
- **Pains:** Tool complexity, low adoption, scattered information

## Part 2: Hands-On Empathy Mapping (15 minutes)

### Exercise Setup (2 minutes)
**Instructions:**
- Work individually first to create an empathy map for your capstone project
- Focus on your primary user type
- Use AI to help generate insights and identify patterns
- We'll share and discuss in cross-role groups

### Individual Empathy Mapping (10 minutes)
**Participant Tasks:**
1. **Identify your primary user** - Who are you building for?
2. **Complete empathy map** - Fill out all four quadrants plus goals and pains
3. **Use AI assistance** - Generate insights about user needs
4. **Synthesize insights** - What are the key takeaways?

**AI Prompting Template:**
```
Help me create an empathy map for [USER TYPE] who needs [FEATURE/SOLUTION].

Consider:
1. What would they say about this problem or solution?
2. What might they be thinking privately?
3. What actions do they currently take?
4. What emotions might they experience?
5. What are their goals and pain points?

Provide realistic, specific insights based on this user type and context.
```

### Group Sharing (3 minutes)
**Brief share-out:**
- 2-3 volunteers quickly share their empathy maps
- Highlight interesting insights or patterns
- Set up for cross-role collaboration

### Collaborative Design Process (15 minutes)

#### Stage 1: Multi-Perspective Empathy (5 minutes)
**Group Task:**
- Each role creates an empathy map from their professional perspective
- PM perspective: Product and user needs
- Designer perspective: User experience and interaction
- Project Manager perspective: Implementation and coordination

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do different roles see the same user differently?
- What unique insights does each perspective bring?
- Where do perspectives align? Where do they differ?

#### Stage 2: Problem Definition (3 minutes)
**Group Task:**
- Synthesize insights from all perspectives
- Define the core problem clearly
- Frame the problem in a way that honors all viewpoints

**Problem Statement Template:**
```
[USER TYPE] needs [SOLUTION/FEATURE] because [INSIGHT FROM EMPATHY].

From a PM perspective: [PRODUCT NEED]
From a designer perspective: [UX NEED]
From a project manager perspective: [IMPLEMENTATION NEED]

The core problem is: [SYNTHESIZED PROBLEM STATEMENT]
```

#### Stage 3: Solution Ideation (4 minutes)
**Group Task:**
- Each role suggests solutions from their perspective
- Build on each other's ideas
- Focus on solutions that preserve user agency

**Ideation Prompts:**
- **PM:** What features would solve this problem?
- **Designer:** How should users interact with this solution?
- **Project Manager:** How can we implement this realistically?
- **All:** How does AI enhance (not replace) human capability?

#### Stage 4: User Flow Design (3 minutes)
**Group Task:**
- Sketch a simple user flow for the solution
- Show where AI is involved and where humans decide
- Ensure user agency is preserved throughout

**User Flow Template:**
```
1. [USER ACTION] → 
2. [AI ASSISTANCE] → 
3. [USER DECISION] → 
4. [AI EXECUTION] → 
5. [USER VERIFICATION] → 
6. [OUTCOME]

Mark at each step:
- ✓ User in control
- ⚠️ Shared decision
- ✗ Automated (with review)
```

### Group Presentations (3 minutes)
**Each group shares (30-45 seconds each):**
- What scenario they worked on
- Key insight from cross-role collaboration
- How their solution preserves user agency
- One challenge they navigated together
