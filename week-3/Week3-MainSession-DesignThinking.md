## Part 1: Teaching Presentation (15-20 minutes)

### Slide 1: Welcome Back & Week 2 Bridge (2 minutes)
**Time:** 2 minutes
**Key Points:**
- Welcome back! How did requirement gathering and tool selection go?
- We've learned how to think architecturally about systems
- Now we'll ensure those systems serve users well and ethically
- Today: Design thinking meets AI development

**Quick Check-in:** Ask participants to share one insight from their requirement gathering process that surprised them.

### Slide 2: Why Human-Centered Design Matters for AI Projects (3 minutes)
**Time:** 3 minutes
**Key Points:**
- **AI makes it easier to build things, but not necessarily the right things**
- Without human-centered thinking, AI projects can:
  - Solve the wrong problems
  - Remove user control and agency
  - Create unintended harm or bias
  - Miss accessibility needs

**The Core Principle:**
**AI should enhance human capability, not replace human judgment**

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Good:** AI suggests edits to your writing, you decide what to accept
- **Bad:** AI automatically sends emails on your behalf without review
- **Good:** AI recommends products based on preferences, you choose
- **Bad:** AI decides what content you see without transparency or control

**Key Insight:**
Technology amplifies human decisions - good design amplifies good outcomes, poor design amplifies problems at scale.

### Slide 3: Design Thinking for AI Development (5 minutes)
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Key Points:**

**The Design Thinking Process:**
1. **Empathize** - Understand user needs and pain points
2. **Define** - Frame the right problem to solve
3. **Ideate** - Explore multiple solution approaches
4. **Prototype** - Build and test quickly
5. **Test** - Gather feedback and iterate

**How AI Fits into Design Thinking:**
- **Empathize:** Use AI to analyze user research and identify patterns
- **Define:** Use AI to help frame problem statements clearly
- **Ideate:** Use AI to brainstorm multiple solution approaches
- **Prototype:** Use AI to build functional prototypes quickly
- **Test:** Use AI to analyze feedback and suggest improvements

**Key Principle:**
**AI accelerates the design thinking process, but humans still drive the direction**

**Empathy Mapping:**
A simple framework to understand users:
- **Says:** What do users say they want or need?
- **Thinks:** What are they really thinking?
- **Does:** What actions do they actually take?
- **Feels:** What emotions are they experiencing?

**Example for a task management tool:**
- **Says:** "I need a better way to organize my tasks"
- **Thinks:** "I'm overwhelmed by too many tools and notifications"
- **Does:** Uses sticky notes and simple lists despite having fancy tools
- **Feels:** Anxious about forgetting important things, frustrated by complexity

### Slide 4: User Agency - Keeping Humans in Control (4 minutes)
**Time:** 4 minutes
**Key Points:**

**What is User Agency?**
**User agency = the ability of users to make informed decisions and maintain control over outcomes**

**The User Agency Spectrum:**
```
FULL AGENCY ←—————————————————————————————————→ NO AGENCY
User decides     AI suggests    AI decides    AI decides    User has no
everything       options        with review   automatically  control
```

**Where to Place Your AI Features:**
- **High-stakes decisions:** Keep agency with users (left side)
- **Routine tasks:** More automation acceptable (right side)
- **Creative work:** User should maintain control (left side)
- **Data processing:** Automation with oversight (middle)

**User Agency Checklist:**
- [ ] **Transparency:** Does the user know AI is involved?
- [ ] **Control:** Can the user override AI decisions?
- [ ] **Understanding:** Does the user understand what AI is doing?
- [ ] **Consent:** Did the user agree to AI involvement?
- [ ] **Reversibility:** Can AI actions be undone?

**Examples:**

**Preserves User Agency (Good):**
- Spotify suggests playlists, you choose what to listen to
- Grammarly suggests edits, you decide what to accept
- Google Photos suggests albums, you finalize and share

**Removes User Agency (Problematic):**
- LinkedIn auto-generates posts without clear review process
- AI automatically responds to important emails
- Algorithm decides what content you see without transparency

### Slide 5: Ethical Considerations in AI Development (5 minutes)
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Key Points:**

**Five Key Ethical Considerations:**

**1. Bias and Fairness**
- AI learns from data that may contain historical biases
- Consider: Who is represented? Who is excluded?
- **Action:** Test with diverse user groups, check for biased outputs

**2. Privacy and Data Protection**
- AI often requires user data to function
- Consider: What data is collected? How is it protected? Who has access?
- **Action:** Minimize data collection, be transparent about usage

**3. Transparency and Explainability**
- Users should understand how AI makes decisions
- Consider: Can you explain why AI recommended something?
- **Action:** Provide clear explanations, avoid "black box" systems

**4. Accessibility and Inclusion**
- AI features should work for everyone
- Consider: Does this work for users with disabilities? Different languages?
- **Action:** Test with assistive technologies, provide alternatives

**5. Environmental Impact**
- AI training and usage consumes significant energy
- Consider: Is AI the right solution? Can you optimize usage?
- **Action:** Use AI thoughtfully, optimize model choices

**The Ethical Framework:**
**For every AI feature, ask:**
1. **Who benefits?** Who might be harmed?
2. **What biases** might exist in the data or design?
3. **How transparent** is the AI's decision-making?
4. **Can users opt out** or override AI decisions?
5. **Is AI necessary** or could simpler solutions work?

### Slide 6: What We'll Practice Today (2 minutes)
**Time:** 2 minutes
**Key Points:**
- We'll practice evaluating AI features for user agency and ethics
- You'll use empathy mapping to understand user needs
- We'll explore how to design AI features that keep humans in control

## Part 2: Hands-On User Agency & Ethics Activity (20-30 minutes)

### Activity Setup (3 minutes)
**Instructions:**
- We'll work in breakout rooms of 3-4 people
- Each group will analyze AI features for user agency and ethics
- Practice empathy mapping and ethical evaluation
- Share insights and get feedback from your group
- We'll reconvene to share discoveries

### Activity Part 1: Evaluating Existing AI Features (10 minutes)

#### Choose one AI feature to evaluate:
**Social Media:**
- Instagram's recommendation algorithm
- TikTok's "For You" page
- LinkedIn's auto-generated posts

**Productivity:**
- Email auto-responses
- Calendar meeting schedulers
- Task priority AI assistants

**Creative Tools:**
- AI writing assistants
- AI image generators
- AI code completion

#### Group Evaluation Process:

**Step 1: User Agency Analysis (5 minutes)**
**For your chosen feature, discuss:**
1. **Where does it fall on the agency spectrum?** (full agency → no agency)
2. **Transparency:** Does the user know AI is involved?
3. **Control:** Can the user override AI decisions?
4. **Understanding:** Does the user understand what AI is doing?
5. **Reversibility:** Can AI actions be undone?

**User Agency Scoring:**
- ✅ **Preserves Agency:** User maintains full control with AI assistance
- ⚠️ **Reduces Agency:** User has some control but limited options
- ❌ **Removes Agency:** User has little to no meaningful control

**Step 2: Ethical Framework Analysis (5 minutes)**
**Evaluate using the five ethical considerations:**

| Consideration | Rating (✅/⚠️/❌) | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Bias & Fairness** | | Does it treat all users fairly? |
| **Privacy & Data** | | How does it handle user data? |
| **Transparency** | | Can users understand how it works? |
| **Accessibility** | | Does it work for everyone? |
| **Environmental Impact** | | Is AI usage justified? |

### Activity Part 2: Designing User-Centered AI Features (10-15 minutes)

#### Choose one scenario to redesign:
**Problem Scenarios:**
1. **Email Assistant:** AI automatically sends responses to customer emails without human review
2. **Content Moderation:** AI automatically removes user posts without explanation or appeal
3. **Hiring Tool:** AI automatically rejects job candidates based on resume screening
4. **Health App:** AI automatically schedules medical appointments based on symptoms

#### Group Design Process:

**Step 1: Empathy Mapping (5 minutes)**
**For your chosen scenario, create an empathy map:**
- **Says:** What does the user say about this problem?
- **Thinks:** What might they be thinking privately?
- **Does:** What actions do they currently take?
- **Feels:** What emotions are they experiencing?

**Example for Email Assistant:**
- **Says:** "I need help managing my inbox"
- **Thinks:** "I'm worried about sending the wrong thing automatically"
- **Does:** Manually writes each email to maintain control
- **Feels:** Overwhelmed by volume, anxious about mistakes

**Step 2: Redesign for User Agency (5-10 minutes)**
**Redesign the feature to preserve user agency:**

**Questions to guide redesign:**
1. **How can AI assist without deciding?**
2. **Where should user review be required?**
3. **How can we make AI decisions transparent?**
4. **What controls should users have?**
5. **How can we make it easy to override or undo?**

**Redesign Template:**
```
Feature: [Name]
Problem: [What's wrong with current approach]

Improved Design:
- What AI does: [AI's role]
- What user does: [User's role]
- How transparency works: [Explanation mechanism]
- How control works: [Override/undo mechanism]
- How it's better: [Why this preserves agency]
```

### Group Sharing (2 minutes)
**Each group shares:**
- One AI feature they evaluated
- Key insight about user agency or ethics
- One redesign improvement they created

### Facilitator Support During Activity
- Circulate through breakout rooms
- Help groups understand user agency concepts
- Point out good examples of ethical thinking
- Encourage critical evaluation of AI features

## Part 3: Q&A and Reflection (10 minutes)

### Quick Share-Out (3 minutes)
**Ask each group:** What was one insight about user agency or ethics that changed your thinking?

### Q&A Session (5 minutes)
**Common questions to be prepared for:**
- "How much user control is too much? Can we over-complicate things?"
- "What if users don't want to be involved in every decision?"
- "How do we balance speed/convenience with user agency?"
- "What if competitors are using AI more aggressively?"
- "How do we know if our AI is biased?"

**Thoughtful Responses:**
- **Too much control:** Use smart defaults with clear override options
- **User preferences:** Different users need different levels of control
- **Balance:** Start with high agency, automate gradually with user consent
- **Competition:** Ethical AI builds long-term trust and loyalty
- **Bias detection:** Test with diverse users, monitor outcomes, iterate

### Reflection Questions (2 minutes)
**Ask participants to think about:**
1. How does human-centered design change your approach to AI projects?
2. What's one way you can improve user agency in your capstone project?
3. What ethical considerations are most important for your project?
