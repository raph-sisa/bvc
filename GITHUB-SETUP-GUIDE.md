## Overview

This workshop uses a **two-repository approach** to maximize learning and build community:

## Two-Repository Workflow Explained

### Why Two Repositories?

**Workshop Repository (Forked):**
✅ Learn collaborative GitHub workflows (fork → PR)  
✅ Share discoveries with entire community  
✅ Practice real-world open source contribution  
✅ Build community connections  
✅ Access all official materials

**Assignment Repository (Personal):**
✅ Private workspace for learning  
✅ Build professional portfolio  
✅ Document personal journey  
✅ Control your own visibility  
✅ Showcase capstone project

### How They Work Together

```

## Common Questions

### "Which repo do I use for assignments?"
**Your personal assignment repository** - the one you created from the template.

### "Where do I submit my work?"
- **Assignments:** Complete in your assignment repo, share link in cohort discussion
- **Resources:** Submit via PR to workshop repo (community-resources folder)

### "Can I make my assignment repo private?"
Yes! You control visibility. Private is fine to start, you can make it public later for your portfolio.

### "What if I find a cool article or tool?"
Add it to your fork of the workshop repo in `community-resources/`, then create a PR to share with everyone!

### "Do I need to keep my fork of workshop repo updated?"
It's helpful to occasionally sync your fork to see new resources others have contributed, but not required.

### "What's a Pull Request (PR)?"
A way to propose changes to the main repository. You make changes in YOUR fork, then "request" they be "pulled" into the main repo.

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't fork the workshop repo"
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Check that you have a verified email
- Try refreshing the page
- Contact facilitator if issue persists

### "The template button doesn't work"
- Try forking instead if "Use this template" isn't available
- Make sure you're logged in
- Contact facilitator for alternative setup

### "I committed to the wrong repo"
- Don't worry! 
- Assignment work → should be in assignment repo
- Resource contributions → should be in workshop repo fork
- Ask facilitator for help moving if needed

### "My PR isn't working"
- Make sure you committed changes to YOUR fork first
- Check that you're creating PR to the original workshop repo
- Review CONTRIBUTING.md for step-by-step instructions
- Ask in cohort discussion or office hours
