### Advanced Prompting Techniques Deep Dive (4 minutes)

**[Visual: Five advanced techniques with examples]**

"Let's explore the advanced prompting techniques that separate good AI users from great ones:

**[Visual: Chain-of-thought prompting example]**

**Technique 1: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

This technique asks AI to show its reasoning step-by-step, leading to better problem-solving and more reliable results.

**Basic Prompt:** "Help me design a user authentication system."

**Advanced Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**
```
Think through designing a user authentication system step by step:

Step 1: Identify the core security requirements
Step 2: Consider different authentication methods and their trade-offs
Step 3: Plan the user flow from login to access
Step 4: Think about edge cases and error handling
Step 5: Recommend the best approach with your reasoning

For each step, explain your thinking process and considerations.
```

**When to Use Chain-of-Thought:**
- Complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning
- When you need to understand AI's decision-making process
- Debugging issues or troubleshooting problems
- Planning and strategy development

**[Visual: Role-playing techniques example]**

**Technique 2: Role-Playing and Persona Prompting**

Have AI adopt specific expertise or perspectives to get more targeted and relevant outputs.

**Basic Prompt:** "Write a product requirements document."

**Advanced Role-Playing Prompt:**
```
You are a senior product manager with 10+ years of experience in mobile applications. You've successfully launched 5+ apps with over 1 million users each.

From this perspective, create a product requirements document for a habit-tracking mobile app. Consider:
- Your experience with user engagement challenges
- Common pitfalls you've seen in similar apps
- Best practices for mobile app development
- Specific metrics you'd track for success

Write as if you're presenting to your development team.
```

**Expert Personas to Try:**
- Senior UX designer specializing in accessibility
- Technical architect with experience in scalable systems
- Business analyst with expertise in data-driven decisions
- Customer success manager focused on user adoption
- Security expert concerned with privacy and protection

**[Visual: Few-shot learning example]**

**Technique 3: Few-Shot Learning with Examples**

Provide specific examples to guide AI toward consistent, high-quality outputs.

**Basic Prompt:** "Generate user stories."

**Advanced Few-Shot Prompt:**
```
Here are 3 examples of good user stories for a project management tool:

1. As a project manager, I want to see all team members' progress in one dashboard so that I can identify bottlenecks quickly.

2. As a team member, I want to update my task status with one click so that I can communicate progress without interrupting my workflow.

3. As a stakeholder, I want to receive automated status updates so that I can stay informed without scheduling additional meetings.

Now write 3 user stories for a [YOUR PROJECT] following this same format and style.
```

**Keys to Effective Few-Shot Learning:**
- Use 2-5 high-quality examples
- Make examples consistent in style and format
- Choose examples similar to what you want
- Be specific about what aspects to emulate

**[Visual: Iterative refinement example]**

**Technique 4: Iterative Refinement**

Build complex outputs through multiple passes, refining and improving each time.

**Step 1:** "Create a basic outline for a customer onboarding process."

**Step 2:** "Based on that outline, add specific steps for each stage."

**Step 3:** "Now add error handling and edge cases for each step."

**Step 4:** "Finally, add success metrics and KPIs for measuring effectiveness."

**When to Use Iterative Refinement:**
- Complex outputs that are hard to get right in one pass
- When you need to build on previous outputs
- For detailed planning or documentation
- When outputs need multiple perspectives or considerations

**[Visual: Constraint-based prompting example]**

**Technique 5: Constraint-Based Prompting**

Set specific limitations and requirements to guide AI toward more targeted outputs.

**Basic Prompt:** "Design a mobile app interface."

**Advanced Constraint-Based Prompt:**
```
Design a mobile app interface for a budget-tracking app with these constraints:

Technical Constraints:
- Must work on screens as small as 4.7 inches
- Maximum 3 taps to reach any core feature
- Offline functionality for basic features

User Constraints:
- Target users are 25-45 years old with basic tech skills
- Must be accessible for users with visual impairments
- Support for multiple languages (English, Spanish, French)

Business Constraints:
- Development budget allows for 3 months of development
- Must integrate with existing bank APIs
- Revenue model based on premium features

Design the interface considering these constraints.
```

**Types of Constraints to Consider:**
- Technical limitations (device capabilities, APIs, performance)
- User constraints (skills, accessibility, preferences)
- Business constraints (budget, timeline, resources)
- Compliance constraints (privacy, security, regulations)"

### Optimization Strategies for AI Workflows (3 minutes)

**[Visual: Workflow optimization strategies]**

"Now let's look at strategies to optimize your AI workflows for efficiency and effectiveness:

**[Visual: Prompt template system]**

**Strategy 1: Build a Prompt Template Library**

Create reusable templates for common tasks to save time and ensure consistency.

**Template Structure:**
```
[ROLE/CONTEXT]: You are [specific role] with [relevant experience]

[TASK]: [Clear description of what you want]

[FORMAT]: [Specific output format requirements]

[EXAMPLES]: [2-3 examples of desired output]

[CONSTRAINTS]: [Any limitations or requirements]

[QUALITY]: [Success criteria for the output]
```

**Example Template - User Story Generation:**
```
Role: Senior product manager with 10+ years experience
Task: Generate user stories for [FEATURE]
Format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
Examples: [Include 2 examples]
Constraints: Must work on mobile, accessible, under 3 taps
Quality: Clear user benefit, testable acceptance criteria
```

**[Visual: Batch processing workflow]**

**Strategy 2: Batch Processing and Workflow Automation**

Group similar tasks and create workflows that chain AI tools together.

**Batch Processing Example:**
Instead of writing 10 individual emails, create a batch prompt:
```
Generate 10 follow-up emails for customers who haven't used our app in 30 days. Each email should:
- Be personalized with their name and last used feature
- Offer specific help based on their usage patterns
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Vary in tone but maintain brand voice

Customer data:
1. Sarah - Last used: Budget tracking, 35 days ago
2. Mike - Last used: Goal setting, 42 days ago
[Continue with all customers...]
```

**[Visual: Context management system]**

**Strategy 3: Smart Context Management**

Optimize how you use and maintain context across conversations.

**Context Optimization Tips:**
- **Summarize key points** before starting new topics
- **Save important context** for future reference
- **Clear context** when switching between unrelated projects
- **Use context windows efficiently** - don't waste tokens on irrelevant information

**Context Management Template:**
```
Project: [Project name]
Current Phase: [What you're working on]
Key Requirements: [Bullet points of main requirements]
Previous Decisions: [Important choices made]
Current Challenge: [What you're trying to solve now]
```

**[Visual: Quality control checklist]**

**Strategy 4: Systematic Quality Control**

Create checklists and processes to ensure consistent output quality.

**Quality Control Checklist:**
- [ ] Does the output meet the stated requirements?
- [ ] Is the format consistent with examples provided?
- [ ] Are there any obvious errors or inconsistencies?
- [ ] Does it align with project constraints?
- [ ] Would this be useful to the intended audience?

**[Visual: Cost optimization dashboard]**

**Strategy 5: Cost and Resource Optimization**

Monitor and optimize your AI usage to control costs and improve efficiency.

**Cost Optimization Tips:**
- **Track usage patterns** to identify optimization opportunities
- **Choose appropriate models** - don't use GPT-4 for simple tasks
- **Optimize prompts** to reduce token usage without losing quality
- **Cache results** when possible to avoid repeated API calls
- **Batch requests** to reduce overhead costs

**Usage Monitoring Questions:**
- Which prompts generate the most useful outputs?
- Where am I spending the most tokens?
- What tasks could be automated or batched?
- Which models provide the best value for different tasks?"

**Problem 3: AI Doesn't Understand Complex Requirements**

**Symptoms:** Outputs miss key requirements or misunderstand the problem

**Solutions:**
- Break complex problems into smaller parts
- Use chain-of-thought prompting to guide reasoning
- Provide more context about your domain
- Iterate and refine rather than trying to get everything in one prompt

**Problem 4: Outputs Are Close But Not Quite Right**

**Symptoms:** AI gets the general idea but misses specific details

**Solutions:**
- Use iterative refinement to build on good outputs
- Add specific constraints for the missing elements
- Try different role-playing personas
- Provide more targeted examples

**Problem 5: Prompts Are Too Long or Complex**

**Symptoms:** AI gets confused or produces irrelevant outputs

**Solutions:**
- Simplify prompts and focus on one main request
- Break complex requests into multiple simpler ones
- Use clear structure and formatting
- Test with shorter prompts first

**[Visual: Systematic troubleshooting approach]**

**The Systematic Troubleshooting Process:**

1. **Identify the specific issue** - What exactly is wrong?
2. **Analyze the prompt** - What might be causing the problem?
3. **Try one solution** - Test a specific fix
4. **Evaluate results** - Did it improve the output?
5. **Document what works** - Save successful patterns for future use"
