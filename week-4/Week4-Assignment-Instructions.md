## Implementation Best Practices

### Building Guidelines:
1. **Start small** - Focus on one functional component
2. **Test frequently** - Don't wait until the end to test
3. **Iterate quickly** - Fix issues as you find them
4. **Document progress** - Track what works and what doesn't
5. **Get feedback** - Share early and often with peers

### Quality Standards:
1. **Functional** - Does it work as intended?
2. **Tested** - Has it been validated against requirements?
3. **Accessible** - Does it work for diverse users?
4. **Ethical** - Does it preserve user agency?
5. **Documented** - Can others understand how it works?

### Optimization Principles:
1. **Measure first** - Understand current performance
2. **Optimize systematically** - One area at a time
3. **Track improvements** - Document what works
4. **Share knowledge** - Help others optimize too
5. **Iterate continuously** - Optimization is ongoing

Remember: This week is about practical implementation. Focus on building something functional and learning from the process, not on creating perfect solutions. Every implementation teaches you something valuable for future projects.
