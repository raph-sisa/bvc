Chain-of-thought prompting asks AI to show its reasoning step-by-step, leading to more thorough analysis and better problem-solving.

### Why It Works
- Forces AI to break down complex problems
- Reveals reasoning process for transparency
- Often leads to better final answers
- Helps identify potential issues early

### Basic Format
```
Think through [PROBLEM] step by step:

Step 1: [First consideration]
Step 2: [Second consideration]
Step 3: [Third consideration]
...
Step N: [Final recommendation with reasoning]

For each step, explain your thinking process.
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Product Strategy
**Basic Prompt:** "Should we add a social sharing feature to our app?"

- Provides style and format guidance
- Helps AI understand subtle requirements
- Reduces need for iteration and refinement

### Basic Format
```
Here are [NUMBER] examples of [TYPE OF OUTPUT]:

Example 1: [Complete example]
Example 2: [Complete example]
Example 3: [Complete example]

Now create [NUMBER] more [TYPE OF OUTPUT] following the same style, format, and quality level.
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: User Stories
**Few-Shot Prompt:**
```
Here are 3 examples of good user stories for a project management app:

1. As a project manager, I want to see all team members' progress in one dashboard so that I can identify bottlenecks and adjust resources quickly.

2. As a team member, I want to update my task status with one click so that I can communicate progress without interrupting my workflow.

3. As a stakeholder, I want to receive automated weekly status reports so that I can stay informed without scheduling additional meetings.

Now write 3 user stories for a habit-tracking mobile app following the same format and style.
```

#### Example 2: Product Requirements
**Few-Shot Prompt:**
```
Here are 2 examples of clear product requirements:

Example 1:

Example 2:
Feature: Task Creation
Requirement: Users must be able to create new tasks quickly
Acceptance Criteria:
- Task creation accessible from main dashboard
- Required fields: title, due date, priority
- Optional fields: description, tags, attachments
- Auto-save draft functionality

Now write 2 product requirements for a budget tracking app following the same format and detail level.
```

#### Example 3: Email Templates
**Few-Shot Prompt:**
```
Here are 2 examples of professional email templates:

Example 1:
Subject: Project Update - [Project Name] - Week of [Date]

## Technique 4: Iterative Refinement

### What It Is
Iterative refinement builds complex outputs through multiple passes, with each pass building on and improving the previous one.

### Why It Works
- Allows for complex, detailed outputs
- Enables building on good foundations
- Provides opportunities for course correction
- Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps

### Basic Process
```
Step 1: [Initial broad request]
Step 2: "Based on that, now [specific refinement]"
Step 3: "Now add [additional detail or perspective]"
Step 4: "Finally, [final polish or integration]"
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Strategic Planning
**Iteration 1:** "Create a high-level strategy for launching a mobile app."

**Iteration 2:** "Based on that strategy, create a detailed 6-month implementation timeline with specific milestones."

**Iteration 3:** "Now add resource requirements and budget estimates for each phase."

**Iteration 4:** "Finally, add risk assessment and mitigation strategies for each major milestone."

#### Example 2: Technical Documentation
**Iteration 1:** "Write a basic API documentation outline for a user management system."

**Iteration 2:** "Based on that outline, add detailed request/response examples for each endpoint."

**Iteration 3:** "Now add error handling documentation with specific error codes and messages."

**Iteration 4:** "Finally, add authentication requirements and rate limiting information."

#### Example 3: Content Creation
**Iteration 1:** "Create a basic outline for a blog post about AI in project management."

**Iteration 2:** "Based on that outline, write the introduction and first section with engaging examples."

**Iteration 3:** "Now expand each remaining section with detailed content and practical tips."

**Iteration 4:** "Finally, add a compelling conclusion and call-to-action."

### Best Practices
- **Start broad, then get specific** - Begin with high-level, then add details
- **Build on what works** - Don't start over if the foundation is good
- **Be specific about improvements** - "Add examples" vs. "make it better"
- **Maintain context** - Reference previous iterations
- **Know when to stop** - Don't over-iterate if results are good

### When to Use
- Complex outputs that are hard to get right in one pass
- When you need to build on previous outputs
- For detailed planning or documentation
- When outputs need multiple perspectives
- For creative work that benefits from development

### When NOT to Use
- Simple, straightforward requests
- When you're not sure what you want
- For time-sensitive tasks
- When starting over might be faster
- If early iterations are fundamentally wrong
