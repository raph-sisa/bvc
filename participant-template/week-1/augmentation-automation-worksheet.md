### Decision Framework

**When deciding whether to augment or automate, I'll consider:**

1. **Human judgment required:** [Low = automate, High = augment]
2. **Creative thinking needed:** [Low = automate, High = augment]
3. **Risk of error:** [Low = automate, High = augment]
4. **Need for human touch:** [Low = automate, High = augment]
5. **Task frequency:** [High = worth automating, Low = augment when needed]
