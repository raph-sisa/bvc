# Technical Requirements

## Minimum Hardware Requirements

### Computer/Device
**Required:**
- Laptop or desktop computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- At least 10GB free storage space
- Webcam (for optional video participation)
- Microphone and speakers/headphones

**Not Recommended:**
- Tablets or mobile devices as primary device (lack full functionality for AI tools)

**For Hands-On Activities:**
- Offline-capable alternatives provided when possible
- Pair with another participant for collaboration
- Extended office hours for catch-up

---

### Computer/Hardware Issues

**During Live Sessions:**
- **Backup Plan A:** Join from mobile device for audio/video, do activities later
- **Backup Plan B:** Use library, coworking space, or friend's computer
- **Backup Plan C:** Full recording and materials available for async participation

**For Tool Access:**
- **Backup Plan A:** Use alternative tool from same category
- **Backup Plan B:** Pair with another participant for shared access
- **Backup Plan C:** Free trial extensions usually available

---

### AI Tool Outages

**If Primary Tool is Down:**
