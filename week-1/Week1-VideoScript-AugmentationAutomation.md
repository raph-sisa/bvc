## Video Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
**[Visual: Workshop logo, friendly instructor on screen]**

"Hi everyone! I'm [Name], and welcome to your Week 1 follow-up video. In our main session, we covered the foundational concepts of how AI tools work. Now we're going to explore a crucial framework that will help you make smart decisions about when and how to use AI in your work: the Augmentation vs. Automation Spectrum."

### What is the Augmentation vs. Automation Spectrum? (2 minutes)

**[Visual: Spectrum diagram with two ends clearly labeled]**

"Let me introduce you to a framework that will change how you think about AI tools. Imagine a spectrum with two ends:

**On the left: Augmentation** - AI helps you do your job better
**On the right: Automation** - AI does your job for you

**[Visual: Spectrum with examples positioned along it]**

Most people think AI is either one or the other, but it's actually a spectrum. Let me show you what I mean with real examples:

**Pure Augmentation (far left):** AI helps you brainstorm ideas for a product feature. You're still doing the thinking, but AI is expanding your creative possibilities.

**Augmentation-Heavy:** AI writes a first draft of your project status email, but you edit it heavily and add your personal insights.

**Middle Ground:** AI creates a basic project timeline, but you review and adjust it based on your team's specific needs.

**Automation-Heavy:** AI automatically generates weekly status reports from your project management tool data.

**Pure Automation (far right):** AI automatically responds to routine customer support tickets without human intervention.

**[Visual: Interactive slider showing how tasks can move along the spectrum]**

Here's the key insight: **The same task can exist at different points on the spectrum depending on context, risk, and your goals.**"

### Why This Framework Matters (1.5 minutes)

**[Visual: Split screen showing good vs. problematic AI usage]**

"Understanding this spectrum is crucial because it helps you avoid two common mistakes:

**Mistake 1: Over-automating too quickly**
**[Visual: Example of problematic automation - AI making important decisions without oversight]**
When you automate something that needs human judgment, you can create problems. For example, letting AI automatically reject job candidates based on resume screening might introduce bias or miss great candidates.

**Mistake 2: Under-utilizing AI's potential**
**[Visual: Example of missed opportunities - person doing repetitive work that could be augmented]**
When you don't leverage AI for tasks that could be significantly improved, you're missing opportunities. For example, manually formatting data that AI could clean up in seconds.

**[Visual: Framework benefits list]**

The Augmentation vs. Automation framework helps you:
- Make deliberate decisions about AI involvement
- Start safely with augmentation and gradually increase automation
- Avoid costly mistakes from over-automation
- Maximize your productivity gains

### The Decision-Making Framework (3 minutes)

**[Visual: Decision tree flowchart]**

"Now let's talk about how to actually use this framework. I'm going to walk you through five key questions to ask about any task:

**[Visual: Question 1 with examples]**

**Question 1: What's the risk if this goes wrong?**
- High risk (customer-facing, financial, legal): Start with augmentation
- Low risk (internal documentation, brainstorming): You can be more aggressive with automation

**[Visual: Question 2 with examples]**

**Question 2: How much human judgment is required?**
- High judgment needed (strategic decisions, creative work): Lean toward augmentation
- Low judgment needed (data formatting, routine responses): Automation might work well

**[Visual: Question 3 with examples]**

**Question 3: How often do you do this task?**
- Rarely: Augmentation is probably fine - don't over-engineer
- Frequently: Automation might be worth the setup time

**[Visual: Question 4 with examples]**

**Question 4: How variable is this task?**
- Highly variable: Augmentation works better
- Standardized: Automation is more feasible

**[Visual: Question 5 with examples]**

**Question 5: What's your current skill level with this task?**
- Beginner: Start with augmentation to learn
- Expert: You might be able to automate more safely

**[Visual: Framework summary with decision matrix]**

Use these questions to plot your task on the spectrum. Remember: **start with augmentation and move toward automation as you gain confidence and evidence that it works well.**"

### Role-Specific Examples (3 minutes)

**[Visual: Three sections for PM, Designer, Project Manager]**

"Let me show you how this framework applies to different roles:

**[Visual: Product Manager section]**

**For Product Managers:**
- **Augmentation:** AI helps you brainstorm user stories, but you refine them based on your product knowledge
- **Middle Ground:** AI drafts competitive analysis, but you add your strategic insights
- **Automation:** AI automatically pulls competitor pricing data into your analysis

**[Visual: Designer section]**

**For Designers:**
- **Augmentation:** AI generates design concepts, but you evaluate and refine them
- **Middle Ground:** AI creates wireframes based on your specifications, but you review and adjust
- **Automation:** AI automatically generates accessibility reports for your designs

**[Visual: Project Manager section]**

**For Project Managers:**
- **Augmentation:** AI helps you identify project risks, but you make the final assessment
- **Middle Ground:** AI drafts status reports, but you customize them for different stakeholders
- **Automation:** AI automatically updates project timelines based on task completion data

**[Visual: Cross-role example]**

**Here's a cross-role example:** Creating project documentation
- **Week 1:** AI helps you brainstorm what to include (augmentation)
- **Week 2:** AI drafts the first version, you edit heavily (augmentation-heavy)
- **Week 3:** AI creates templates you customize (middle ground)
- **Week 4:** AI automatically generates docs from your project data (automation-heavy)

The key is **starting where you're comfortable and gradually increasing AI involvement as you build confidence.**"

### Your Decision-Making Worksheet (2 minutes)

**[Visual: Worksheet template on screen]**

"I've created a worksheet to help you apply this framework to your actual work. You'll find it in your Week 1 materials.

**[Visual: Worksheet sections being filled out]**

**Step 1:** List 5-10 tasks you do regularly in your work
**Step 2:** For each task, answer the five questions we discussed
**Step 3:** Plot each task on the augmentation-automation spectrum
**Step 4:** Pick 2-3 tasks to start with - ideally ones that are low-risk and high-frequency
**Step 5:** Plan your approach: Start with augmentation, then gradually increase automation

**[Visual: Example worksheet partially filled out]**

Here's an example for a Product Manager:
- Task: Writing user stories
- Risk: Medium (affects development, but can be revised)
- Judgment needed: High (requires product knowledge)
- Frequency: High (weekly)
- Variability: Medium (similar structure, different content)
- Skill level: High (experienced)
- **Recommendation:** Start with augmentation - use AI to help brainstorm and draft, but review and refine everything

**[Visual: Action items]**

**Your homework this week:**
1. Complete the worksheet with your actual work tasks
2. Pick one task to try with AI augmentation
3. Share your experience in our cohort discussion

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid (1.5 minutes)

**[Visual: Warning signs with examples]**

"As you start applying this framework, here are some common pitfalls to watch out for:

**[Visual: Pitfall 1]**

**Pitfall 1: The 'Set It and Forget It' Trap**
Don't automate something and then ignore it. Even automated processes need monitoring and occasional adjustment.

**[Visual: Pitfall 2]**

**Pitfall 2: The Perfectionism Paralysis**
Don't wait for the perfect automation setup. Start with augmentation and improve over time.

**[Visual: Pitfall 3]**

**Pitfall 3: The One-Size-Fits-All Approach**
Different tasks need different approaches. A framework that works for data analysis might not work for creative writing.

**[Visual: Pitfall 4]**

**Pitfall 4: Ignoring the Human Element**
Remember that AI should enhance human work, not replace human judgment. Keep the human in the loop for important decisions.

**[Visual: Success indicators]**

**Signs you're on the right track:**
- You're saving time without sacrificing quality
- You're learning new skills while using AI
- You're comfortable with your level of AI involvement
- You can explain why you chose augmentation vs. automation for each task"
