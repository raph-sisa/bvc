## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your App (5 minutes)
**Select an app you use regularly and know well. Consider:**
- **Mobile apps:** Instagram, Spotify, Uber, banking apps, productivity tools
- **Web apps:** Gmail, Slack, Notion, Airbnb, shopping sites
- **Avoid:** Apps you've never used or know very little about

**Why this matters:** You need domain knowledge to evaluate AI's analysis and provide meaningful context.

### Step 2: Initial AI Analysis (20 minutes)
**Use AI to conduct a comprehensive app analysis. Apply the R-R-F-E framework:**

#### Role Definition:
```
You are a software architect and product analyst with 10+ years of experience in mobile and web application design. You specialize in breaking down complex applications into their core components and understanding how they work together to deliver user value.
```

#### Request:
```
Analyze [APP NAME] from an architectural and product perspective. Provide a comprehensive breakdown that covers:

1. **Core User Journeys:** What are the main ways users interact with this app?
2. **Key Features & Components:** What are the major features and how might they be built as separate components?
3. **Data Flow:** How does information move through the app? (user input → processing → display)
4. **Integration Points:** What external services or APIs does this app likely connect to?
5. **User Experience Patterns:** What design patterns and UX conventions does it use?
6. **Business Logic:** What are the key rules and processes that govern how the app works?
```

#### Format:
```
Structure your analysis with clear headings and bullet points. For each section, provide:
- Specific examples from the app
- Your reasoning for why things are designed this way
- Questions that would need to be answered to build this feature
```

#### Examples:
```
If analyzing Instagram, you might discuss:
- User journey: Sign up → Follow people → Post content → Discover content → Interact
- Components: Feed algorithm, photo editor, messaging system, story system
- Data flow: Photo upload → Image processing → Content delivery network → Display
- Integrations: Camera API, cloud storage, push notifications, analytics
```

### Step 3: Deep Dive Analysis (30 minutes)
**Pick one specific feature or component from the AI's analysis and go deeper:**

#### Choose One Feature:
- A feature you find particularly interesting
- A feature that seems complex or well-designed
- A feature that relates to your professional role
- A feature you've always wondered how it works

#### Deep Dive Prompt:
```
Focus specifically on the [FEATURE NAME] in [APP NAME]. Provide a detailed architectural analysis including:

1. **User Interaction Flow:** Step-by-step how a user interacts with this feature
2. **Technical Components:** What technical pieces would be needed to build this?
3. **Data Requirements:** What data does this feature need to store, process, and display?
4. **Edge Cases:** What happens when things go wrong or in unusual situations?
5. **Performance Considerations:** What might be slow or resource-intensive about this feature?
6. **Alternative Approaches:** How else could this feature be designed? What are the trade-offs?
```

### Step 4: Role-Specific Analysis (20 minutes)
**Apply your professional perspective to the analysis:**

#### For Product Managers:
```
From a product management perspective, analyze [APP NAME]:

1. **Value Proposition:** What core problem does this app solve for users?
2. **User Segmentation:** Who are the different types of users and how do their needs differ?
3. **Feature Prioritization:** If you were prioritizing features for the next release, what would you focus on?
4. **Success Metrics:** How would you measure if this app is successful?
5. **Competitive Analysis:** How does this compare to similar apps? What's unique?
6. **Business Model:** How does this app make money or create value for the company?
```

#### For Designers:
```
From a UX/UI design perspective, analyze [APP NAME]:

1. **Design System:** What visual and interaction patterns create consistency?
2. **Information Architecture:** How is content organized and navigated?
3. **User Experience Flow:** How does the design guide users through their goals?
4. **Accessibility:** What accessibility features or considerations are evident?
5. **Responsive Design:** How does the design adapt to different screen sizes or devices?
6. **Emotional Design:** How does the design create specific feelings or experiences?
```

#### For Project Managers:
```
From a project management perspective, analyze [APP NAME]:

1. **Project Scope:** If you were managing the development of this app, what would be the major work streams?
2. **Dependencies:** What features or components depend on others being completed first?
3. **Risk Assessment:** What could go wrong during development or after launch?
4. **Resource Requirements:** What types of team members would be needed?
5. **Timeline Considerations:** Which parts would take the longest to develop?
6. **Quality Assurance:** How would you test this app to ensure it works properly?
```

### Step 5: Reflection and Synthesis (15 minutes)
**Analyze your experience and connect to learning objectives:**

#### Reflection Questions:
1. **Context Engineering:** How did the R-R-F-E framework help you get better results from AI?
2. **Architectural Thinking:** What surprised you about thinking about apps as systems of components?
3. **AI Limitations:** Where did the AI's analysis seem incomplete or inaccurate? How did you know?
4. **Role Perspective:** How did applying your professional lens change your understanding of the app?
5. **Week 2 Preview:** What questions do you now have about software architecture that you'd like to explore?

#### Synthesis Challenge:
**Write a 2-3 sentence summary that connects your app analysis to Week 2's architectural thinking concepts.**

Example: *"Analyzing Spotify's recommendation system helped me understand how complex features are actually composed of many smaller components working together. This makes me curious about how to break down my own work projects into manageable pieces and how AI can help with that architectural thinking process."*

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Challenges:

**"The AI's analysis seems generic"**
- Provide more specific context about the app
- Ask follow-up questions about specific features
- Use the deep dive approach to get more detailed analysis

**"I don't know enough about the app"**
- Choose a different app you use more frequently
- Focus on features you interact with regularly
- Use the analysis to learn more about the app

**"The AI seems to be making things up"**
- This is normal! Use your domain knowledge to evaluate
- Ask the AI to explain its reasoning
