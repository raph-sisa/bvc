## Step 2: Framework Application
For each task above, answer the five key questions:

### Task 1: ________________________________

**Question 1: What's the risk if this goes wrong?**
- [ ] High risk (customer-facing, financial, legal, reputation)
- [ ] Medium risk (internal processes, team efficiency)
- [ ] Low risk (personal organization, routine tasks)

**Question 2: How much human judgment is required?**
- [ ] High judgment (strategic decisions, creative work, complex problem-solving)
- [ ] Medium judgment (standard processes with some customization)
- [ ] Low judgment (routine tasks, data formatting, simple responses)

**Question 3: How often do you do this task?**
- [ ] Daily
- [ ] Weekly
- [ ] Monthly
- [ ] Rarely (less than monthly)

**Question 4: How variable is this task?**
- [ ] Highly variable (different every time)
- [ ] Somewhat variable (similar structure, different content)
- [ ] Standardized (same format and process each time)

**Question 5: What's your current skill level with this task?**
- [ ] Beginner (still learning, need guidance)
- [ ] Intermediate (comfortable, some expertise)
- [ ] Expert (highly skilled, can teach others)

**Recommendation:** Based on your answers, where should this task start on the spectrum?
- [ ] Pure Augmentation (AI helps, you lead)
- [ ] Augmentation-Heavy (AI does most, you review/refine)
- [ ] Middle Ground (AI and human work together)
- [ ] Automation-Heavy (AI does it, you monitor)
- [ ] Pure Automation (AI does it independently)

## Step 3: Spectrum Plotting
Create a visual representation of where your tasks fall on the augmentation-automation spectrum.

```
AUGMENTATION ←———————————————————————————————————————————————→ AUTOMATION
(Pure)        (Heavy)        (Middle)        (Heavy)        (Pure)
AI helps      AI does most   AI and human    AI does it,    AI does it
you lead      you review     work together   you monitor    independently

Your Tasks:
1. [Task name] ——————————————————————————————●
2. [Task name] ———————————————●
3. [Task name] —————————————————————————————●
4. [Task name] ———————————●
5. [Task name] ————————————————————————————————●
```

## Step 4: Priority Selection
Based on your analysis, select 2-3 tasks to start with this week. Choose tasks that are:
- Low to medium risk
- High frequency (you do them often)
- Good candidates for augmentation (not pure automation)

### Priority Task 1: ________________________________
**Why this task?** ________________________________
**Starting approach:** ________________________________

### Priority Task 2: ________________________________
**Why this task?** ________________________________
**Starting approach:** ________________________________

### Priority Task 3: ________________________________
**Why this task?** ________________________________

## Cohort Discussion Prompts

Share your experience with the cohort using these prompts:

### Required Post (choose one):
- **"My AI Experiment":** Share one task you tried with AI this week. What worked? What didn't? What did you learn?
- **"Spectrum Insights":** Which of your work tasks surprised you when you plotted them on the spectrum? Why?

### Optional Responses:
- Comment on 2-3 other participants' posts with questions or insights
- Share resources or tools you discovered
- Ask for advice on tasks you're struggling with

## Additional Resources

### Quick Reference: Decision Framework
1. **Risk Assessment:** High/Medium/Low risk if AI makes mistakes
2. **Judgment Level:** High/Medium/Low human judgment required
3. **Frequency:** Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Rarely
4. **Variability:** High/Medium/Low variation in task
5. **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate/Expert

### General Guidelines:
- **Start with augmentation** - AI helps, you lead
- **High risk + High judgment** = Stay closer to augmentation
- **Low risk + Low judgment** = You can be more aggressive with automation
- **High frequency** = Worth investing time in AI integration
- **High variability** = Augmentation works better than automation

### Red Flags (Don't Automate):
- Customer-facing decisions without oversight
- Financial or legal decisions
- Tasks you don't fully understand yet
- One-time or very rare tasks
- Tasks requiring significant creativity or innovation

Remember: **The goal is thoughtful integration, not blind automation.**
