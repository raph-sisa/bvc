# Week 1 Assignment: Foundation Building & First Steps
## Due: End of Week 1 | Time Commitment: 2-3 hours

### Overview
This week's assignment helps you apply what you've learned about AI fundamentals and start building your GitHub skills. You'll practice context engineering, explore the augmentation vs. automation framework, and begin your journey with version control.

## Required Components

### 1. Cohort Discussion Participation (30 minutes)

**Instructions:** Participate in our cohort discussion by posting and responding to others' posts.

#### Required Post (Choose One):
**Option A: "My AI Experiment"**
- Share one task you tried with AI this week using the context engineering principles from our main session
- Include: What task did you try? What prompt did you use? What worked well? What was challenging? What would you do differently next time?

**Option B: "Spectrum Insights"**
- Which of your work tasks surprised you when you plotted them on the augmentation vs. automation spectrum?
- Share: What task surprised you and why? Where did you place it on the spectrum? What factors influenced your decision?

#### Required Responses (2-3 posts):
- Comment on at least 2-3 other participants' posts with questions, insights, or encouragement
- Ask follow-up questions to deepen the discussion
- Share resources or tips that might help others

#### Discussion Guidelines:
- **Be specific:** Share concrete examples from your actual work
- **Be supportive:** Encourage others and ask constructive questions
- **Be curious:** Ask questions that help everyone learn
- **Be honest:** Share both successes and challenges

### 2. AI Tool Practice (45 minutes)

**Instructions:** Apply the context engineering principles from our main session to a real work task.

#### Choose One Task:
Pick one task from your regular work that you can safely practice with AI. This should be:
- Low to medium risk (won't cause problems if it doesn't work perfectly)
- Something you do regularly
- Appropriate for augmentation (AI helps, you lead)

#### Practice Process:
1. **Before using AI:** Write down what you normally do for this task
2. **Apply context engineering:** Use the R-R-F-E framework (Role-Request-Format-Examples)
3. **Test your prompt:** Try it with your chosen AI tool
4. **Evaluate results:** What worked? What didn't? How could you improve?
5. **Iterate:** Try the improved prompt and compare results

#### Reflection Questions:
- How did the AI output compare to your usual approach?
- What context engineering techniques were most helpful?
- What would you change about your prompt for next time?
- How might you use this approach in your regular work?
