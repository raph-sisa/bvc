## Session Structure

### Part 1: Welcome & Project Check-In (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Set supportive tone, assess needs, organize support structure

#### Opening (3 min)

**Facilitator Welcome:**
"Welcome to our final office hours! This is it‚Äîthe last structured time we have together before you take these skills forward independently. Today is about three things:

1. **Support:** Getting help finishing your capstone projects
2. **Feedback:** Sharing work and learning from each other
3. **Celebration:** Recognizing how far you've come

Whether your project is 100% done or 30% done, you're in the right place. Let's make the most of this hour together."

**Icebreaker Question (in chat or verbally):**
"What's one word to describe how you feel about your capstone project?"

Quick share-out (2 min) - Acknowledge range of emotions (pride, stress, excitement, overwhelm)

#### Quick Project Status Check (5 min)

**Facilitator:**
"Let's quickly see where everyone is so we can organize support effectively."

**Poll or Chat Check-In:**
Type in chat:
- ‚úÖ **Done:** Project is complete or nearly complete
- üõ†Ô∏è **In Progress:** Working on it, making good progress
- ‚ùì **Stuck:** Hit a specific roadblock
- üÜò **Need Help:** Struggling significantly or just starting

**Quick Summary:**
"Okay, I see we have [X] nearly done, [Y] in progress, [Z] stuck on something specific, and [N] needing help. Great‚Äîwe'll organize our time accordingly."

#### Organizing the Hour (2 min)

**Format Options Based on Attendance:**

**Option A: Small Group (< 12 participants)**
- Everyone stays together
- Go around for individual support
- Group learns from each person's questions
- More intimate, collaborative

**Option B: Medium Group (12-20 participants)**
- Split time between:
  - Individual spotlights (15 min)
  - Breakout peer feedback (15 min)
  - Open help queue (10 min)

**Option C: Large Group (20+ participants)**
- Breakout rooms by status/need
- Facilitators rotate through rooms
- Peer support within rooms
- Reconvene for celebration

**Facilitator announces structure:**
"Here's how we'll use our time: [explain chosen format]. We'll make sure everyone gets support, even if we need to follow up asynchronously after this session."

---

### Part 2: Capstone Project Support (35 minutes)

**Purpose:** Provide hands-on troubleshooting, feedback, and guidance

#### Format A: Small Group Rotation (< 12 participants)

**Structure:** ~3-4 min per participant, everyone learns from each

**Process:**
1. Participant shares: "Here's my project [30 sec demo/description] and here's where I'm stuck [30 sec]"
2. Facilitator + group helps: Troubleshooting, suggestions, resources [2-3 min]
3. Next action identified: "Your next step is X"
4. Move to next participant

**Facilitator Role:**
- Keep time gently but firmly
- Ask clarifying questions
- Connect to workshop concepts
- Suggest specific next steps
- Invite group input: "Has anyone solved something similar?"

**Example Exchange:**

*Participant:* "I'm building a requirements gathering tool but can't get the AI to format outputs consistently."

*Facilitator:* "Great project! This is a common challenge. Are you using structured prompts with specific formatting examples in your context?"

*Participant:* "Sort of, but it varies."

*Facilitator:* "Let's try adding explicit formatting instructions. [Screenshares example prompt]. See how this gives the AI a template to follow? Try that structure."

*Group member:* "I had the same issue‚Äîusing markdown formatting in my prompt helped a lot."

*Facilitator:* "Perfect! So your next step: revise your prompt with explicit formatting, test it, then iterate. Post in the alumni channel if you're still stuck."

*Next participant...*

#### Format B: Breakout Rooms by Need (12+ participants)

**Room 1: "Nearly Done" Room**
- **Focus:** Polish, final touches, presentation prep
- **Facilitator activity:**
  - Quick reviews of completed work
  - Presentation feedback
  - "What's next?" planning

**Co-Facilitator Coordination:**
- One facilitator per breakout room (or rotate if only 2 facilitators)
- Communicate via private chat about who needs follow-up
- Document support requests for post-session follow-up

#### Format C: Open Help Queue

**Structure:** Participants "raise hand" for individual support

**Setup:**
- Participants put themselves in queue (Zoom raise hand, or numbered chat messages)
- Facilitator calls on people one at a time
- Others work independently while waiting (or break into peer pairs)

**While in queue:**
"While you're waiting, pair up with someone nearby in the participant list and do mutual progress shares‚Äî5 min each to show your project and get quick feedback."

**Individual Support (~3-5 min each):**
- Screen share and work through issue together
- Real-time troubleshooting
- Specific, actionable next step
- "Got what you need? Great‚Äîkeep building!"

#### Common Challenges & Facilitator Responses

**Challenge:** "I can't get [tool] to work at all."
**Response:**
- Identify if it's tool issue vs. approach issue
- Try different tool if persistent problems
- Pair with someone who's succeeded with that tool
- Share alternative approach: "Let's try [different method]"

**Challenge:** "My project is too ambitious and not done."
**Response:**
- Scope down immediately: "What's the MVP of your MVP?"
- Identify one feature that demonstrates learning
- Reframe: "You don't need everything‚Äîyou need one thing working well"
- Set realistic completion goal: "Can you finish [specific piece] by end of today?"

**Challenge:** "I don't know if this is any good."
**Response:**
- Demo it right now‚Äîlet's see what works
- Identify what IS working (always something)
- Connect to workshop concepts: "You applied [concept] here‚Äîthat's great!"
- Ask: "Does it solve the problem you set out to solve?"
- Remind: This is learning, not perfection

**Challenge:** "I'm totally stuck and don't even know what question to ask."
**Response:**
- Start from beginning: "Walk me through what you're trying to do"
- Identify exactly where the stuck point is
- Break problem into smallest possible pieces
- Pick ONE piece to solve right now
- Sometimes stuck = unclear goal: "What would 'done' look like?"

**Challenge:** "It works, but I want to make it better."
**Response:**
- Celebrate that it works!
- Identify highest-impact improvement
- Balance polish vs. done
- Note improvements for future iteration
- Remind: "Done is better than perfect for learning"

**Instructions:**
"I'm putting you in pairs for 8 minutes. Here's the structure:

**First 4 minutes: Person A shares**
1. Person A: Share screen and show your project (2 min)
   - What you built
   - One thing you're proud of
   - One thing you'd improve next time
2. Person B: Give feedback using 'I notice / I appreciate / I wonder' (1.5 min)
3. Brief discussion (30 sec)

**Switch! Next 4 minutes: Person B shares**
(Same structure)

**Go‚ÄîI'll bring you back in 8 minutes!**"

**Co-Facilitator:** Set timer, visit breakout rooms to monitor

#### Option B: Speed Networking (Larger groups)

**Instructions:**
"We'll do 3 rounds of 3-minute peer feedback. In each round:
- 1 min: Share your project screen and explain
- 1 min: Partner gives feedback
- 1 min: Switch roles

I'll call time for each transition. Let's go!"

**Facilitator manages timing:**
- "1 minute‚Äîshare your project!"
- "Switch‚Äînow your partner shares!"
- "Moving to round 2‚Äîfind a new partner!"

Fast-paced, energizing, everyone gets multiple perspectives

#### Reconvene

**Facilitator:** "What did you notice seeing others' projects?"

**Quick share-out (2 min):**
- Themes across projects
- Creative approaches
- Learning from peers

**Key Message:**
"The diversity of projects shows the range of what you can do with these skills. There's no one 'right' project‚Äîthere's what serves YOUR work and goals."

---

### Part 4: Celebration & Closing (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Recognize growth, celebrate community, launch forward momentum
