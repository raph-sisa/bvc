# Tips for All Formats

### Do's
- ✅ **Be specific:** Show don't just tell
- ✅ **Include visuals:** Screenshots, diagrams, GIFs, video
- ✅ **Be authentic:** Share real challenges and learnings
- ✅ **Focus on outcomes:** What problem did you solve?
- ✅ **Make it skimmable:** Use headings, bullets, white space
- ✅ **Proofread:** Check for typos and clarity
- ✅ **Link to demo:** Let people see it working

### Don'ts
- ❌ **Don't apologize:** No "this isn't perfect" or "I'm not a real developer"
- ❌ **Don't compare:** Your journey is yours alone
- ❌ **Don't over-explain code:** Focus on approach and outcomes
- ❌ **Don't make it too long:** Respect readers' time
- ❌ **Don't skip the learning:** That's often the most valuable part

### Remember
Your perspective as a non-developer learning to build is VALUABLE. Others in your role want to see what's possible. Your "beginner's" journey is inspiring and educational for others.
