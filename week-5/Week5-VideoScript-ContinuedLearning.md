## Script

### SECTION 1: OPENING (1-2 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Title slide with workshop branding]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Welcome to the final video in our Beyond Vibe Coding series. If you're watching this, you've completed five weeks of learning how to leverage AI tools as a product professional—congratulations!

Over the past five weeks, you've learned how LLMs work, how to think architecturally, how to design ethically, and how to build functionally. You've transformed from someone curious about AI tools into someone who can actually build with them.

But here's the thing: this workshop wasn't designed to teach you everything. It was designed to give you the **foundation** to keep learning on your own. And that's exactly what we're going to talk about in this video.

**[VISUAL: Show workshop journey - Week 1 through Week 5 icons]**

We'll cover three things:
1. Why continued learning matters and how to make it sustainable
2. Specific resources and pathways based on your role and goals  
3. How to build a community of practice that keeps you growing

Let's dive in."

### SECTION 2: THE LEARNING MINDSET (2-3 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Section title slide - "Making Learning Sustainable"]**

**SCRIPT:**

"First, let's talk about the mindset that will serve you best as you continue this journey.

**[VISUAL: Show two contrasting approaches - 'Intensive bursts' vs 'Consistent practice']**

The temptation after finishing a workshop is to either go all-in with intensive learning OR to completely stop and wait for motivation to strike again. Neither of these approaches tends to work long-term.

What DOES work is what I call the **'Build-Reflect-Teach' cycle.**

**[VISUAL: Animated cycle diagram showing three phases]**

**BUILD:** Apply what you know by creating something real—even something small. This could be a feature for your product, an automation for your workflow, or a prototype for an idea you have. The key is: make it real, not theoretical.

**REFLECT:** After building, pause and think about what worked, what didn't, and what you learned. This reflection is where deeper understanding happens. You might journal, talk with a colleague, or just take a walk and think it through.

**TEACH:** Share what you learned with someone else. This could be a teammate, a friend, a post in a community, or even a conversation over coffee. Teaching solidifies your understanding and reveals gaps you didn't know you had.

**[VISUAL: Show cycle repeating]**

Then you do it again: build something slightly more complex, reflect on the new learning, teach someone what you discovered. This cycle compounds over time.

**[VISUAL: Show timeline - '30 days' → '90 days' → '6 months']**

Here's what this looks like in practice:

**First 30 days:** Build one small project applying workshop concepts. Reflect on what you learned. Share your process with one person.

**Next 60 days (days 31-90):** Build 2-3 more projects with increasing complexity. Start documenting your learnings. Maybe write a blog post or give a presentation to your team.

**Months 4-6:** Take on a more ambitious project. Mentor someone else who's starting their AI journey. You'll be amazed at how much you've internalized.

The goal isn't to become a full-time AI researcher. It's to continuously expand your capability to build, evaluate, and collaborate using AI tools in YOUR role.

**[VISUAL: Return to presenter or key quote slide]**

Remember: you're not trying to learn everything. You're trying to get 1% better every week."

### SECTION 4: BUILDING YOUR LEARNING PLAN (2-3 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Section title slide - "Your 30-Day Action Plan"]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Okay, you've seen a lot of resources. Now let's make this actionable with a simple framework.

**[VISUAL: Show template/framework]**

I want you to answer four questions. You can download this template from the video description.

**Question 1: What's one skill I want to improve in the next 30 days?**

Be specific. Not 'get better at AI'—that's too vague. Instead:
- 'Build functional prototypes faster'
- 'Gather better requirements using AI'
- 'Automate my weekly reporting'

Write yours down right now. Pause the video if you need to.

**[VISUAL: Pause icon with 'Take a moment...']**

**Question 2: What's one project I'll build to practice this skill?**

This should be real and useful to you, not just a practice exercise. Something you'll actually use or that solves a real problem.

Examples:
- A prototype of a feature I'm spec'ing
- A tool that automates my standup updates
- An interactive design for a client project

**Question 3: What's one resource I'll use to learn?**

Pick ONE from the lists I shared earlier. You can always add more, but start with one focused resource. Maybe it's a YouTube channel, a community, or a course.

**Question 4: Who will I share my learning with?**

This is your accountability and your 'teach' step. Who will you show your work to and talk about what you learned?

Could be:
- Your manager or a teammate
- The alumni community
- A friend or family member
- Your LinkedIn network

**[VISUAL: Show completed example]**

Here's what this might look like:

**Skill:** Build interactive prototypes faster  
**Project:** Prototype our new dashboard feature  
**Resource:** v0.dev tutorials + our alumni community  
**Share with:** My design team in our next retro  

**30-Day Commitment:** I'll spend 3-4 hours per week on this. I'll build, reflect on what I learn, and share progress weekly in the alumni channel.

**[VISUAL: Template again]**

That's it. Four questions, one plan, 30 days.

And here's the most important part: at the end of 30 days, you'll repeat this process with a new skill, project, and resource. Each 30-day cycle builds on the last."

### SECTION 5: STAYING CONNECTED - COMMUNITY (1-2 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Section title slide - "Your Learning Community"]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Learning alone is hard. Learning with others is energizing and sustainable.

Here's how to stay connected:

**[VISUAL: Show alumni community platform]**

**1. Join the Alumni Community**

We've set up a space just for workshop participants—current and future cohorts. Here you can:
- Share projects and get feedback
- Ask questions and troubleshoot
- Find accountability partners
- Attend monthly co-working sessions
- Celebrate wins together

The link to join is in the video description.

**[VISUAL: Show calendar or event info]**

**2. Attend Optional Events**

We're hosting:
- **Monthly co-working sessions:** Bring a project, work together virtually
- **Guest speaker events:** People doing cool things with AI tools
- **Office hours:** Drop-in troubleshooting and support

These are all optional, but they're great for staying connected and keeping momentum.

**[VISUAL: Show social media or blog]**

**3. Build in Public**

Consider sharing your learning journey publicly—on LinkedIn, X, or a blog. You don't need to be an expert; you just need to share what you're learning and building.

This does three things:
- Keeps you accountable
- Helps others who are learning
- Builds your professional brand

Even a simple post like 'Week 1 of building with AI: here's what I learned' is valuable.

**[VISUAL: Return to presenter]**

Community is optional, but it's powerful. The people who stay connected to a learning community tend to progress much faster than those who go solo."

### SECTION 6: CLOSING & NEXT STEPS (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Closing slide with key takeaways]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Let's wrap this up.

**You've completed five weeks of intensive learning.** You understand how LLMs work, how to think architecturally, how to design ethically, and how to build practically.

**But this is just the foundation.** Your real growth happens in the next 30, 60, 90 days as you apply these skills to real projects in your work.

**Your action steps:**

**[VISUAL: Checklist appearing]**

1. ✅ Complete your 30-day action plan (use the template in the description)
2. ✅ Join the alumni community
3. ✅ Pick 2-3 resources from this video to explore
4. ✅ Start building something real this week—don't wait

**[VISUAL: Final inspirational slide]**

Remember: you're not trying to become a developer. You're becoming an AI-powered professional in YOUR role—product manager, designer, project manager.

The tools will keep evolving. New AI capabilities will emerge. But the **framework** you learned—foundation, architecture, ethics, implementation, integration—that framework will serve you no matter what tools come next.

**[VISUAL: Thank you slide with resources]**

Thank you for being part of this cohort. We can't wait to see what you build.

All the resources mentioned in this video are linked in the description. Download the continued learning guide, join the community, and most importantly: keep building.
