**Transition:**
"Now let's get everyone into breakout rooms so you can all share your work and get feedback!"

### Breakout Showcase (12-15 min)

**Setup:**
- Groups of 3-4 participants
- Mix experience levels if possible
- Assign one person as timekeeper
- Share feedback structure in chat/screen

**Breakout Instructions (share verbally + in chat):**

```
BREAKOUT SHOWCASE INSTRUCTIONS (12 minutes total)

1. Choose a timekeeper (keeps everyone to ~3-4 minutes each)
2. Each person presents their capstone project:
   - The challenge you addressed (30 sec)
   - Your approach and tools used (1-2 min)
   - Demo or walkthrough (1-2 min)
   - Key learning or surprise (30 sec)
3. After each presentation, group gives 1-minute feedback using:
   - "I noticed..." (specific observation)
   - "I appreciate..." (strength or effort)
   - "I wonder..." or "What if..." (constructive suggestion)
4. Repeat for each person in your group
5. Return to main room when time ends

Be supportive, specific, and celebratory!
```

**While in Breakouts (Facilitator Actions):**
- Visit each breakout room briefly
- Check in on timing and dynamics
- Offer encouragement
- Note any standout projects to mention in closing

**Reconvene After Breakouts:**
- "Welcome back! How did that feel?"
- Quick reactions in chat or verbally (1-2 min)

### Peer Feedback Structure

**Framework: "I noticed / I appreciate / I wonder"**

**I noticed...** (Specific observation)
- "I noticed you used architectural thinking to break down the feature into components"
- "I noticed you explicitly considered user agency in your design"

**I appreciate...** (Recognition of strength or effort)
- "I appreciate how you balanced automation with user control"
- "I appreciate the iteration you did based on testing"

**I wonder...** or **What if...** (Constructive, curious suggestion)
- "I wonder if you could apply this approach to other features?"
- "What if you added [specific idea] in the next iteration?"

**Effective Feedback Guidelines:**
- ✅ Specific and actionable
- ✅ Kind and constructive
- ✅ Focused on learning and growth
- ✅ Based on workshop concepts
- ❌ Vague or generic
- ❌ Critical without suggestions
- ❌ Focused on code quality

- Create psychologically safe space for vulnerability

---

## Co-Facilitator Coordination

### Lead Facilitator
- Deliver synthesis presentation (Part 1)
- Facilitate live capstone presentations
- Lead closing reflection and future paths
- Manage overall time

### Co-Facilitator
- Monitor chat for questions and reactions
- Manage breakout rooms (assign, monitor, retrieve)
- Support technical issues during presentations
- Facilitate breakout instructions
- Contribute observations during synthesis
- Handle post-session logistics

### Handoff Points
- After live presentations: Co-fac takes over breakout setup
- During breakouts: Both visit rooms
- Reconvene: Lead resumes facilitation
- Closing: Co-fac shares practical next steps (survey, alumni)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Presentations Run Long
- Solution: Gently cut to 5 min, skip third live presentation
- Move extra presenters to featured in breakouts

### Low Energy or Participation
- Solution: Acknowledge fatigue, shorten reflection, focus on celebration
- Use chat more than open mic

### Technical Issues with Demos
- Solution: "Let's move to screenshot/walkthrough instead"
- Emphasize learning over perfect demo

### Emotional Moments (tears, overwhelm)
- Solution: Normalize, pause briefly, acknowledge growth is emotional
- "This work matters, and your effort shows"

### Running Short on Time
- Solution: Extend Q&A, add reflection questions, deeper discussion
