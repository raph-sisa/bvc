# Week 5 Assignment: Capstone Project & Continued Learning Setup
## Beyond Vibe Coding Workshop for Product Professionals

---

## Assignment Overview

Welcome to your final workshop assignment! Week 5 brings together everything you've learned across foundation (Week 1), architecture (Week 2), design thinking (Week 3), and implementation (Week 4) into a complete capstone project. This assignment has two parts:

1. **Complete and submit your capstone project** (required)
2. **Set up your continued learning plan** (required)
3. **Create a portfolio piece** (optional but recommended)

This assignment demonstrates your learning and sets you up for continued growth beyond the workshop.

## Part 1: Capstone Project (Required)

### What is the Capstone Project?

Your capstone project is a real, functional piece of work that demonstrates your ability to apply AI tools to solve a problem relevant to your role. This is NOT about writing perfect code—it's about showing you can:

- Apply workshop concepts to a real problem
- Select and use appropriate AI tools
- Think architecturally and gather requirements
- Consider ethical implications and user agency
- Build, test, and iterate on something functional
- Reflect on your process and learning

### Capstone Options

Choose ONE of the following four capstone paths based on your role and interests:

#### Option 1: Build a Functional Prototype
**Best for:** Product Managers, anyone wanting to validate a product idea

**What to create:**
- A working prototype of a feature or product concept
- Interactive and testable (doesn't need to be production-ready)
- Demonstrates core functionality

**Examples:**
- Customer feedback analysis dashboard
- Feature prototype for your product
- Internal tool for your team
- MVP of a product idea

**Requirements:**
- Functional demo (video or live)
- Brief documentation of what it does
- Reflection on process

---

#### Option 2: Design an AI-Enhanced Experience
**Best for:** Designers, UX professionals

**What to create:**
- Complete user experience design for an AI-powered feature or product
- Interactive prototype showing key user flows
- Consideration of user agency and ethical implications

**Examples:**
- AI-assisted design tool workflow
- User-facing AI feature with agency controls
- Redesign of existing product with AI enhancement
- Design system for AI-powered interface

**Requirements:**
- Interactive prototype (Figma, Framer, or similar)
- User flow documentation
- Ethical considerations documented
- Reflection on design decisions

---

#### Option 3: Optimize a Workflow with AI
**Best for:** Project Managers, operations professionals

**What to create:**
- Automated or AI-enhanced workflow solving a real problem
- End-to-end process showing before/after improvement
- Integration of multiple tools if needed

**Examples:**
- Automated reporting system
- AI-assisted meeting notes and action items
- Project status dashboard
- Resource allocation tool
- Team workflow automation

**Requirements:**
- Working automation/tool
- Documentation of workflow (before/after)
- Reflection on time savings and impact

---

#### Option 4: Custom Proposal (Pre-Approved)
**Best for:** Anyone with a specific use case not covered above

**What to create:**
- Your proposed project that demonstrates workshop learning
- Must be pre-approved by facilitators

**Process:**
1. Submit brief proposal (2-3 paragraphs) by end of Week 3
2. Get facilitator feedback and approval
3. Build your custom project

**Requirements:**
- Meets minimum criteria (see below)
- Demonstrates multiple workshop concepts
- Produces functional outcome

---

### Minimum Capstone Criteria

Regardless of which option you choose, your capstone must:

✅ **Solve a real problem** - Not just a practice exercise  
✅ **Use AI tools meaningfully** - AI is central, not peripheral  
✅ **Demonstrate learning** - Applies concepts from multiple workshop weeks  
✅ **Be functional** - Works, even if imperfect  
✅ **Include reflection** - Shows self-awareness of process and learning  

### What Your Capstone Is NOT

❌ **NOT about perfect code** - Focus on outcomes, not code quality  
❌ **NOT about complexity** - Simple and functional beats complex and broken  
❌ **NOT about comparison** - Your project serves YOUR goals  
❌ **NOT production-ready** - This is a learning prototype

*Example: "Share progress weekly in alumni community + present final result to design team"*

**5. Weekly Commitment**
- How many hours per week will you commit?
- When in your schedule will this happen?
- What's your backup plan if you miss a week?

*Example: "3 hours per week - Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 1.5 hours each. If I miss, I'll do a catch-up Saturday morning."*

## FAQs

**Q: What if my project isn't finished by the deadline?**
A: Submit what you have with documentation of what's done and what would be next. Learning from an incomplete project is still valuable. If you need an extension, email facilitators at least 48 hours before the deadline.

**Q: Can I work with a partner on the capstone?**
A: Collaborative projects are allowed IF both people contribute substantially and submit individual reflections explaining their contributions. Check with facilitators first.

**Q: What if I want to change my capstone topic?**
A: That's fine! Just make sure you can complete it by the deadline. If you're changing late (Week 4+), consider a simpler scope.

**Q: Do I have to make my portfolio piece public?**
A: No! Portfolio pieces are optional, and you can keep them private. Only share what you're comfortable sharing.

**Q: Will I get feedback on my capstone?**
A: Yes! Facilitators will provide brief individual feedback on all capstone projects within 1 week of submission.

**Q: What if I'm stuck and can't figure out a technical problem?**
A: Attend Week 5 office hours for live help, post in alumni community #help channel, or email facilitators for support. You're not alone!

**Q: Can I iterate on my capstone project after the workshop?**
A: Absolutely! We encourage it. Many of the best projects continue to evolve. Share your updates in the alumni community.

**Q: What happens after I submit?**
A: Facilitators review all submissions, provide individual feedback, compile highlights/success stories, and continue supporting you through the alumni community.

**Q: Is there a "best" capstone project?**
A: No! The best capstone is the one that solves a problem YOU care about and demonstrates YOUR learning. There's no competition or ranking.
