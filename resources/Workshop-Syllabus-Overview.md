# Beyond Vibe Coding: Workshop Syllabus
## AI Tools for Product Professionals

---

## Overview

This 5-week workshop teaches product professionals how to use AI tools to build prototypes, validate ideas, and work effectively with technical teams‚Äîwithout becoming developers.

**Focus:** Outcomes over code. You'll build functional prototypes, not perfect code.

---

## What You'll Learn

**Core Skills:**
- Understand how LLMs work (strengths, limitations, when to use them)
- Engineer better prompts through context engineering
- Think architecturally and break down features into buildable components
- Select appropriate AI tools for different use cases
- Design ethically with user agency in mind
- Use GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Build and test functional prototypes
- Optimize workflows with advanced prompting

**Mindset Shifts:**
- "I can't build" ‚Üí "I can build and test ideas"
- "I need engineering" ‚Üí "I can validate before involving engineering"
- "AI is magic" ‚Üí "AI is a tool I understand and control"

---

## Quick FAQs

**Never coded before?** This workshop is designed for non-developers. If you can use web applications, you can do this.

**Expensive tools required?** No. Complete everything with free tools. Paid subscriptions ($20-40 total) make some things easier but aren't required.

**Fall behind?** Office hours, recordings, and community support help you catch up.

**Can't finish capstone?** Submit what you have with documentation. Partial completion with reflection is acceptable.
