## Welcome & Overview

### Welcome! 👋

Congratulations on taking the step to learn how product professionals can harness AI tools to build, prototype, and collaborate more effectively. This isn't a workshop about becoming a developer—it's about expanding your capabilities to ship faster, validate ideas earlier, and work more effectively with technical teams.

### What Makes This Workshop Different

**Focus on Outcomes, Not Code**
- You'll learn to build things that work, not to read or write perfect code
- We emphasize testing ("does it work?") not reviewing ("is the code good?")
- Success means shipping functional prototypes, not mastering programming

**Role-Specific Applications**
- Examples and projects tailored to Product Managers, Designers, and Project Managers
- Real-world scenarios from your daily work
- Practical skills you can apply immediately

**Progressive Learning**
- Start with foundations (how LLMs work)
- Build through architecture and design thinking
- End with practical implementation and your own capstone project
- Each week builds naturally on the previous one

**Community-Centered**
- Learn with and from your peers
- Collaborative exercises and peer feedback
- Alumni community for ongoing support
- No competition, just growth

---

### Core Skills
✅ **Understand how LLMs work** - Know their strengths, limitations, and when to use them  
✅ **Engineer better prompts** - Get significantly better outputs through context engineering  
✅ **Think architecturally** - Break down features and products into buildable components  
✅ **Select the right tools** - Choose appropriate AI tools for different use cases

## FAQs

### Before the Workshop

**Q: I've never coded. Can I really do this?**
A: Absolutely! This workshop is designed specifically for non-developers. We focus on using AI tools to build, not on writing code from scratch. If you can use web applications, you can do this.

**Q: What if I fall behind?**
A: Office hours, recordings, and community support are designed to help you catch up. We also have a support system to identify and help participants who need extra assistance. One missed session is fine; we'll help you get back on track.

**Q: Do I need to buy expensive tools?**
A: No! You can complete the entire workshop using only free tools. Paid subscriptions ($20-40 total) make some things easier but aren't required.

**Q: How technical is this really?**
A: We explain technical concepts in accessible ways. You'll learn *about* architecture and systems without needing a CS degree. The focus is on applying concepts, not memorizing technical details.

**Q: What if my schedule changes?**
A: Main sessions are recorded for review. While live attendance is ideal, you can catch up via recordings. Let facilitators know if you have scheduling conflicts.

### During the Workshop

**Q: What if I don't understand something?**
A: Ask! In sessions, in community, in office hours. Everyone has questions. What feels confusing to you is probably confusing to others too.

**Q: Can I use different tools than recommended?**
A: Yes! Recommendations are guidance, not requirements. Use tools that work for you. Ask facilitators if you're unsure about a substitution.

**Q: How long should assignments take?**
A: Required portions: 1-2 hours. Optional extensions: 1-2 additional hours. If you're spending significantly more time, ask for help—you might be overthinking it.

**Q: What if I can't finish my capstone?**
A: Submit what you have with documentation of what's complete and what would be next. Partial completion with reflection is better than not submitting. Extensions possible with advance notice.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**
A: Capstone projects can be collaborative if both people contribute substantially and submit individual reflections. Check with facilitators first.

### After the Workshop

**Q: Will I have continued access to materials?**
A: Yes! All recordings, documents, templates, and resources remain accessible. Alumni community continues indefinitely.

**Q: What if I want to keep learning?**
A: We provide a comprehensive resource library, 30-day action planning framework, and ongoing alumni community support. Plus monthly co-working sessions.

**Q: Can I retake the workshop?**
A: [Policy depends on your program - typically alumni can audit future cohorts]

**Q: Will I get a certificate?**
A: [If applicable: Yes, upon completion of capstone project. If not: This workshop focuses on practical skills rather than certification.]

## A Note Before You Begin

You're about to embark on a journey that will fundamentally change how you work. Five weeks from now, you'll be able to build things you currently describe to others, validate ideas before involving engineering teams, and collaborate more effectively across technical boundaries.

This workshop is designed with you in mind—not developers trying to get faster, but professionals from non-technical backgrounds learning to leverage powerful new tools. Your perspective as a product manager, designer, or project manager is valuable. Your "beginner's mind" will help you catch assumptions that developers miss.

**Three things to remember:**

1. **Everyone starts somewhere.** No one in this workshop was born knowing how to use AI tools. We're all learning together.

2. **Progress over perfection.** You'll build things that work, not things that are perfect. That's exactly the point—shipping functional prototypes is the goal.

3. **Community over competition.** Your cohort is your support system. Help each other, celebrate each other, and learn from each other.

We're excited to have you in this cohort. Let's build something amazing together.

**Welcome to Beyond Vibe Coding!** 🚀
